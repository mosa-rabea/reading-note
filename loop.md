## Loops and iteration

* ### Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly. This chapter of the JavaScript Guide introduces the different iteration statements available to JavaScript.

* ## You can think of a loop as a computerized version of the game where you tell someone to take X steps in one direction, then Y steps in another. 
* ## There are many different kinds of loops, but they all essentially do the same thing: they repeat an action some number of times. (Note that it's possible that number could be zero!)

* ## The various loop mechanisms offer different ways to determine the start and end points of the loop. There are various situations that are more easily served by one type of loop over the others.

* for statement
